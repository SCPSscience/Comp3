Scientists around the world are studying the ways in which Earth's weather and climate changes over time.  Researchers in college settings, scientists who work for corporations, and even scientists who work for governmental organizations like NASA, the EPA, the Department of Energy, and others are all very interested in learning about fluctuations in Earth's systems.  They measure and record data and analyze it much like a doctor looks at blood pressure, pulse, and blood sugar levels to determine the health of their patient.  \n","\n","Unlike a physical at your doctor's office who use a few measurements to get a snapshot of how healthy you are, these scientists must make use of **MASSIVE** amounts of data that has been gathered from all over the world to assure the accuracy of their conclusions.  The amount information can be so overwhelming that scientists make use of computer systems to summarize and analyze it.  \n","\n","In today's coding lesson you will be making use of a small sliver of the type of historical data that scientists use to study weather and climate.  The first data set comes from a temperature sensor that has been gathering data at Orlando International Airport from 1975 to the start of 2017.  By looking at this local data we will try to get a grasp on the differences between weather and climate.  \n","\n","After this we will be looking at global temperature fluctuations begining in the year 1880 and runing to this year.  This data compiles the average global surface temperatures changes from historical records as well as from [NASA'sGISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) ([original file](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv)) \n","\n","If you find this sort of thing interesting, that site has lots of other data sets in csv format that are downloadable.

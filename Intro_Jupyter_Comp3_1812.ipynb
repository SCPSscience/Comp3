Learning how to code is a lot like learning a new language, the language you will begin to learn today is called _**Python**_.  Python is a language used to write phone applications, program websites, and by scientists for data analysis.  Just like in a foreign language class, you aren't expected to write in paragraphs right away.  **Jupyter Notebooks** is a coding tool that helps you learn to \"speak\" python by breaking code into small parts called **blocks**, writing one block of code is a lot like writing one sentence (if you learn to write enough sentences, you can eventually write paragraphs).\n","\n","The block you are reading right now is called a markdown.  The purpose of a **markdown** is to give you easy to read instructions or explanations between coding blocks.  Try double-clicking on this paragraph, how does what you see change when you go _\"behind the scenes\"_?  (When you are done, hold the shift key and press the enter key, that's how you run your block so you can see what your code does)  \n","\n","<center>Access the coding booklet [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c_D8TUwvP5K-diEZMzHVxWSCc8OVv9gJxL4f_n4B-tw)</center>"]},{"metadata":{"id":"C-Jk5XVqyRmn","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <center>Part 1: Mastering Markdown</center>"]},{"metadata":{"id":"p0KQbAOqLbBj","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Give it a try!

Markdown blocks are like code but they are not (It was fun though, wasn't it?!).  \n","\n","Before you can start coding you need to import a library.  **Libraries** are sets of pre-made code that you can use without having to type a lot (less work = good!).  When you start a new coding project in Jupyter Notebooks you have to choose what libraries (or types of tools) you will need.  Fortunately, we always do this part for you!  If you don't import the libraries you need into your Jupyter Notebook then it won't work.  So far the only block type that you've used has been markdown but to do this you will need a **Code Block** like the one you see after this.  Unlike markdown blocks, **code blocks** start with [  ] next to them that turn into a play icon when you hover your mouse over them.\n","\n","We pre-filled in some real code for you in the code block just below this, yay!
